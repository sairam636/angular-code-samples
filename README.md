Description
===========
This was just some of the code which I was working in my current project.

priorityQueue
=============

I was mainly invlolved in creating priority queues which we had used for filtering the patients depending on different criteria such as their last medication, last call, number of medications, workflow state ....etc.

We have created this so that the  pharmacist can easily contact the patient.
